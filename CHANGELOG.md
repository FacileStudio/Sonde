# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- build(client): bump muse to v0.14.4 (from v0.14.2). Switching the language in the user menu re-renders the whole UI at once, with no reload. A single 100% DonutChart slice draws as a full ring.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-11-07

### Security

- Registre tokens are sealed at rest. porte to v0.13.0: `porte_identities.access_token` and `refresh_token`
  are encrypted with AES-256-GCM under `PORTE_TOKEN_KEY`. Existing rows are sealed once, in the background,
  after boot, and the count is logged. An invalid `PORTE_TOKEN_KEY` stops the boot. With the key unset nothing changes.
- Losing `PORTE_TOKEN_KEY` makes the stored tokens unreadable: people sign in again, nothing else is lost.
  Do not roll back to a build older than porte v0.13.0 after the first reseal.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-11-07

### Changed

- `@facile/muse` v0.14.1 to v0.14.2: the user menu clamps itself inside the viewport at the right edge of a header.
- The user menu has a Subscription row that opens `https://sso.facile.studio/spaces`, where plans are managed.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-11-07

### Fixed

- The bundled Solar icon collection is regenerated for muse v0.14.1, so the user menu's glyphs (Help, external link, Language, Theme) are served locally instead of fetched from the icon API, which the CSP blocks.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-07

### Changed

- build(client): bump muse to v0.14.1. The sidebar user card and the mobile avatar open muse's `UserMenu` (Account, Settings, Language, Theme, Help, Sign out); the settings cog is gone. The language and theme picks are persisted (cookie and `sonde-theme`) and the theme is applied before hydration.
- Settings use muse's `SettingsLayout` in the canonical order: Profile, Preferences, Notifications, Bus, Advanced. Profile is read-only with "Manage on Facile"; Preferences (language and theme) replaces Appearance; the danger zone ends Advanced; sign-out left the settings and lives in the user menu.
- `/settings/appearance` redirects to `/settings/preferences`.
- The language picked in the menu now wins over the Registre profile locale on the next load.
- The uptime bar's empty cells use `fc-field` instead of the deprecated `fc-border`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-07

### Changed

- build(api): bump porte to v0.12.1. The GDPR erasure no longer fails on a schema without `porte_magic_links`.
- build(client): bump muse to v0.13.0. Form controls are borderless fills, `Select` is muse's own combobox and badges stay on one line.
- The incident list on a monitor page marks each row with a filled dot instead of a left border.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-06

### Changed

- porte v0.5.2 to v0.12.0, porte/directory v0.3.0, tronc v0.16.0 to v0.17.1, @facile/muse v0.11.0 to v0.12.1.
- Sign-in goes through Registre only. The login page is muse `AuthScreen`, the landing page uses `LandingHeader`, `LandingFooter` and `SignInWithFacile`.
- An existing local account links by verified email at its first Facile sign-in, and only when it holds no other subject of the same issuer. An unverified claim never rewrites a stored address.
- `GET /api/auth/me` and `GET /api/users/me` return the user's `locale`.
- The UI is translated into fr, en, es and de. Dates, numbers and durations use Intl in the session locale.
- The production boot refuses to start without `OIDC_ISSUER`.
- tronc security headers are on: enforced anti-framing, report-only CSP with the client's inline script hashes.
- CI runs build, tests against Postgres, svelte-check and filet.

### Removed

- `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, the local password kit, the register tab and the password form.
- `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` and `SSO_ONLY` (delete `SSO_ONLY` from the Dokploy env after deploy).

### Added

- Migration `00005_launch.sql`: `porte_login_codes.provider` and `.subject`, `users.locale`, `directory_state`.
- GDPR deletion: Registre erasures delete the person's monitors, webhooks, sessions and account. Erasing the only administrator promotes the oldest remaining account, so status pages stay manageable.
- `GET /version`, fed by the `APP_VERSION` build arg.
